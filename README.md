# GPSI_tool_box
Matlab code for efficient source identification and parameter estimation of DNAPL-polluted aquifer using hybrid homotopy-PSO algorithm and multi-kernel extreme learning machine

Groundwater pollution source identification (GPSI), which is critical for taking effective measures to protect groundwater resources, assess risks, and design remediation strategies, belongs to an inverse problem of mathematical equations with significant nonlinearity and ill-posedness. Regarding the inversion of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) sources, the special characteristics of pollutants render related research more complex. In the present tool box, homotopy-based optimization inverse theory and multi-kernel extreme learning machine (MK-ELM) were combined for efficiently solving GPSI problem while estimating aquifer parameters at a DNAPL-polluted site. The extreme learning machine incorporating multi kernels with genetic algorithm (GA) was embedded in an optimization model for source inversion to replace the multiphase flow simulation model and to mitigate the considerable computational burdens of inversion iteration. The hybrid homotopy-particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was constructed as a more efficient method for segmentally searching the global optimum in wide areas with low dependence on initial value. Results showed that the application of GA-based MK-ELM and hybrid homotopy-PSO effectively accomplish the simultaneous identification of groundwater pollution sources and aquifer parameters.
The main program was named 'H_PSO_identification.m' in the folder of 'Hybrid_homotopy-PSO_for_GPSI'. The established MK-ELM approximation model had 8 input variables and 3 output variables, and 100 training samples and 20 testing samples were listed in 'Syangben.txt'.
