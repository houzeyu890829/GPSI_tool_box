# GPSI_tool_box
Matlab code for efficient source identification and parameter estimation of DNAPL-polluted aquifer using hybrid homotopy-PSO algorithm and multi-kernel extreme learning machine

The main program was named 'H_PSO_identification.m' in the folder of 'Hybrid_homotopy-PSO_for_GPSI'. The established MK-ELM approximation model had 8 input variables and 3 output variables, and 100 training samples and 20 testing samples were listed in 'Syangben.txt'.
